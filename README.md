# Remix Metal Stacks

This repo contains or will contain a variety of Remix stacks that utilize Rust crates to do performance intensive tasks. I'm thinking I'll refer to them as the Metal Stacks, with different genres of metal denoting different remix adapters, hosted on different branches

**NOTE**

Remix Stacks were just announced today (Mar 16, 22), and while I'm setting everything up, this is still very WIP. Pull Requests Welcome.
